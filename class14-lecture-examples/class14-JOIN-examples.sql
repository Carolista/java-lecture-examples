# Create a new table, artist, with an artist_id, name, and style
# Add AUTO_INCREMENT keyword for artist_id


# Add records for van Gogh, da Vinci, Vermeer, and Monet (ids will auto-generate)


# Select an inner join on the artwork table using the artists' names 


# Run the previous query but eliminate duplicates 


# List all artwork titles and artists and add style using a left inner join


# List all artwork titles and artists and add full_name and style using a right inner join


# List all records using a full outer join of both tables
